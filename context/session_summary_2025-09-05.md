# College Football Imperial Map - Session Summary
**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Duration:** Full development session  
**Status:** Map styling and Supabase integration completed

## üéØ Session Objectives
1. Style the map to match the provided reference image
2. Set up and test Supabase database integration
3. Fix map rendering issues and data compatibility

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Map Styling Transformation
**Problem:** Map looked terrible - only showing scattered county polygons on dark background
- **Before:** 5 isolated county polygons, no recognizable US shape
- **After:** Complete US geography with 3,221 counties, professional styling

**Key Changes:**
- Updated viewport to focus on continental US (longitude: -96.0, latitude: 39.5, zoom: 3.2)
- Replaced OpenStreetMap tiles with dark ocean background (#1a2332)
- Added Alaska and Hawaii as overlay insets in bottom-right corner
- Enhanced county borders with zoom-responsive styling
- Added team symbols (ALA, AUB, USC, TEX, etc.) on larger territories
- Implemented hover tooltips showing county info and controlling teams

### 2. Comprehensive US Counties Dataset
**Problem:** Only had 5 sample counties in tiny GeoJSON file
**Solution:** Downloaded complete US counties dataset
- **Source:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json
- **Scale:** 3,221 counties vs 5 sample counties
- **Coverage:** All US states, territories, and counties

### 3. Supabase Database Integration
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully operational with 20 college football teams

**Database Setup:**
- All required tables created (teams, territories, territory_ownership, games, territory_history, job_runs)
- 20 major college football teams populated with authentic data:
  - Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State, Texas, USC, Notre Dame
  - LSU, Florida, Clemson, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Penn State
  - Oklahoma, Miami, Stanford, Nebraska, Tennessee

**API Performance:**
- First API call: 418ms (database query)
- Subsequent calls: 1ms (cached response)
- Proper caching headers (1 hour cache, 24-hour stale-while-revalidate)

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes

#### MapLibre Rendering Issues
**Problem:** "Map failed to load" error with glyphs property missing
**Root Cause:** Text symbols require glyphs property for font rendering
**Fix:** Added glyphs URL to map style configuration
```javascript
glyphs: "https://fonts.openmaptiles.org/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf"
```

#### GeoJSON Data Structure Compatibility
**Problem:** Data processing code expected `feature.properties.fips` but new dataset used `feature.id`
**Fix:** Updated data processing to handle new structure:
```javascript
const fipsCode = feature.id as string
// Map properties: NAME ‚Üí name, CENSUSAREA ‚Üí area
```

#### React Strict Mode Issues (Previous Session)
**Problem:** Double mounting causing WebGL context loss and network spam
**Fix:** Disabled React Strict Mode in next.config.mjs
